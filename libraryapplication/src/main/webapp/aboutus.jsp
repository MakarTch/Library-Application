					<p>Located on the edge of Prospect Park in the heart of
						Brooklyn, the Central Library has been a Brooklyn icon since
						opening in February 1941 and has been a designated New York City
						landmark since 1997!</p>
					<p>Central Library first opened its doors to the public on
						February 1, 1941. With its breathtaking façade, sweeping grand
						lobby and vast contemporary and historical collections, it has
						been a Brooklyn icon since its opening. The library was designated
						a New York City Landmark in 1997 and joined the National Register
						of Historic Places in 2002.</p>
					<p>Central Library is Brooklyn's home library, and one of New
						York City's foremost cultural, civic, and educational
						institutions. It is home to the Brooklyn Collection, the world's
						largest public archive for the study of Brooklyn's social and
						cultural history; the Dr. S. Stevan Dweck Cultural Center, home to
						our premiere programming series BPL Presents; the Shelby White &
						Leon Levy Information Commons, an innovative public coworking and
						meeting space offering the latest technology; and a Business and
						Career Center, offering books, resources and assistance on job
						search, small business entrepreneurship and personal finance.
						Three floors of collections span a multitude of subjects, and
						include rare reference resources as well as books and materials in
						more than 30 languages.</p>
						<p>Central Library receives more than 1.2 million visits each
						year, and items from its collections circulate 1.6 million times.

					<p>Groundbreaking for a Brooklyn central library on Prospect
						Park Plaza (now Grand Army Plaza) occurred in 1912. The original
						architect Raymond Almirall had designed a domed, four-story
						Beaux-Arts building, similar in style to the adjacent Brooklyn
						Museum. Escalating costs and political infighting slowed
						construction throughout the decade. Because of World War I and the
						Great Depression, Almirall's building was never completed except
						for the Flatbush Avenue wing, which was finished in 1929. In the
						1930s, architects Githens and Keally were commissioned to redesign
						the building in the Art Deco style, eliminating the expensive
						ornamentation and the fourth floor. Construction recommenced in
						1938, and Almirall's building on Flatbush Avenue was largely
						demolished except for the frame, but some of the original facade
						along the library's parking lot is still visible. </p>
						<p> Completed by late 1940, the Central Library opened to the public on February 1,
						1941. It was publicly and critically acclaimed at the time. The
						second floor of the Central Library opened in 1955, nearly
						doubling the amount of space available to the public. Occupying
						over 350,000 square feet and employing 300 full-time staff
						members, the building serves as the administrative headquarters
						for the Brooklyn Public Library system. Prior to 1941 the
						Library's administrative offices were located in the Williamsburgh
						Savings Bank on Flatbush Avenue.</p>
